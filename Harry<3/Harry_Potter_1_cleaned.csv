Dumbledore;I should've known that you would be here, Professor McGonagall.
McGonagall;Good evening, Professor Dumbledore.
McGonagall;Are the rumors true, Albus?
Dumbledore;I'm afraid so, professor.
Hagrid;Professor Dumbledore, sir.
Hagrid;No, sir.
McGonagall;They're the worst sort of Muggles, imaginable.
Dumbledore;It's not really goodbye, after all.
Dudley;Wake up, cousin!
Petunia;Here he comes, the birthday boy.
Vernon;Happy birthday, son.
Petunia;Why don't you just cook the breakfast, and try not to burn anything.
Harry;Yes, Aunt Petunia.
Vernon;Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy.
Harry;Yes, Uncle Vernon.
Petunia;Aren't they wonderful, darling?
Petunia;is that when we go out, we're going to buy you two new presents.
Petunia;How's that, pumpkin?
Vernon;I'm warning you now, boy.
Vernon;Any funny business, any at all...
Harry;He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day...
Harry;It's just, I've never talked to a snake before.
Harry;I mean, do you talk to people often?
Harry;You're from Burma, aren't you?
Petunia;It's all right, sweetheart.
Harry;I swear, I don't know!
Harry;One minute the glass was there and then it was gone, it was like magic.
Petunia;Vernon, just look at him!
Petunia;In just a week, he'll be off to Smeltings.
Petunia;This is what you'll going to be wearing, when I finish dyeing it.
Dudley;Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!
Harry;Hey, give it back! It's mine!
Petunia;Have a lovely day at the office, dear.
Vernon;Fine day, Sunday.
Vernon;In my opinion, best day of the week.
Vernon;Why is that, Dudley?
Vernon;Right you are, Harry!
Vernon;No blasted letters today! No, sir.
Dudley;Mummy, what's happening?
Vernon;Far away, where they can't find us!
Dudley;Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?
Harry;Make a wish, Harry.
Vernon;I demand that you leave at once, Sir!
Hagrid;Well, of course you are.
Hagrid;Afraid I might have sat on it at somepoint, but I imagine it'll taste fine just the same.
Hagrid;Baked it myself, words and all.
Hagrid;It's not every day that your young man turns 11, now is it?
Harry;Excuse me, who are you?
Hagrid;Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.
Hagrid;Of course, you know all about Hogwarts.
Harry;Sorry, no.
Hagrid;You're a wizard, Harry.
Harry;No, you've made a mistake.
Harry;I mean, I'm just Harry.
Hagrid;Anything you couldn't explain, when you were angry or scared?
Harry;Dear Mr. Potter,
Petunia;Then she met that Potter, and then she had you...
Petunia;Just as strange, just as abnormal.
Hagrid;he'll be under the finest headmaster that Hogwarts has ever seen, Albus Dumbledore.
Hagrid;Strickly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic.
Hagrid;Ooh, We're a bit behind schedule.
Hagrid;Unless you'd rather stay, of course.
Hagrid;Essential bit of equipment, Harry.
Harry;Hagrid, Do they mean from a real dragon?
Hagrid;They don't mean a penguin, do they?
Hagrid;Vastly misunderstood beasts, Harry.
 either an owl," a cat or a toad."""
Man;Welcome back, Mr. Potter.
Witch;Doris Crockford, Mr Potter.
Hagrid;Hello, professor. I didn't see you there.
Hagrid;Harry, This is Professor Quirrell. 
Harry;Oh, nice to meet you.
Hagrid;See, Harry? You're famous.
Harry;But why am I famous, Hagrid?
Harry;All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?
Hagrid;I'm not sure I'm exactly the right person to tell you that, Harry.
Hagrid;And over there, all your bits and bobs for doing your wizardry.
Hagrid;Well there's your money, Harry.
Hagrid;Gringotts, the wizard bank.
Hagrid;Ain't no safer place, not one.
Harry;Hagrid, what exactly are these things?
Hagrid;They're goblins, Harry.
Hagrid;Oh, Wait a minute.
Hagrid;Oh, and there's something else as well.
Griphook;Lamp, please.
Griphook;Key, please.
Hagrid;Didn't think your mum and dad will leave you with nothing, now did ya?
Harry;What's in there, Hagrid?
Hagrid;Can't tell you, Harry.
Hagrid;Best not to mention this to anyone, Harry.
Hagrid;A wand? Well, you'll want Ollivanders.
Ollivander;I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter.
Harry;Sorry, but what's curious?
Ollivander;I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter.
Ollivander;It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather resides in your wand, gave another feather.
Ollivander;The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter.
Ollivander;After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things.
Ollivander;Terrible yes, but great
Hagrid;You all right, Harry?
Harry;He killed my parents, didn't he?
Harry;You know, Hagrid. 
Hagrid;First, and understand this Harry because it's very important:
Hagrid;No, I can't spell it.
Hagrid;All right, Voldemort.
Hagrid;It was dark times, Harry. Dark times.
Hagrid;Nobody, not one.
Hagrid;Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry.
Hagrid;A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse, and an evil curse at that.
Hagrid;Well, some say he died.
Hagrid;Codswallop, in my opinion.
Hagrid;Nope, I reckon he's out there still too tired to carry on.
Hagrid;Blimey, is that the time?
Hagrid;Well, he'll be wanting to see me.
Hagrid;Stick to it, Harry that's very important. 
Harry;There's no such thing, is there?
Harry;Excuse me Sir, Can you tell me where I might find platform 9 3/4?
Trainmaster;9 3/4? Think you're being funny, do ya?
Mrs. Weasley;Platform 9 3/4, this way.
Mrs. Weasley;Fred, you next.
George;He's not Fred, I am.
Mrs. Weasley;Not to worry, dear.
Ron;I'm Ron, by the way.
Ron;I mean, do you really have the...?
Woman;Anything off the trolley, dears?
Ron;No, thanks. I'm all set.
Ron;There's chocolate and peppermint and there's also spinach, liver and tripe.
Harry;These aren't real frogs, are they?
Ron;Besides, It's the cards you want.
Ron;Oh, that's rotten luck.
Harry;Hey, he's gone!
Ron;This is Scabbers, by the way.
Ron;Pathetic, isn't he?
Hermione;Oh, are you doing magic?
Hermione;Let's see, then.
Hermione;Of course, I've only tried a few simple ones myself but they've all worked for me.
Hermione;That's better, isn't it?
Hermione;Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter!
Hermione;You've got dirt on your nose, by the way.
Hagrid;Right, then.
Hagrid;Come on now, hurry up.
Hagrid;Hello, Harry.
Harry;Hey, Hagrid.
Hagrid;Right, then. This way to the boats.
McGonagall;But before you can take your seats, you must be sorted into your houses.
McGonagall;They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff Ravenclaw and Slytherin.
McGonagall;Any rule-breaking, and you will lose points.
McGonagall;At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup
Malfoy;It's true then, what they're saying on the train.
Malfoy;This is Crabbe, and Goyle.
Malfoy;Think my name's funny, do you?
Malfoy;We'll soon find out that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter.
Harry;I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks.
Hermione;It's not real, the ceiling. 
McGonagall;Now, before we begin Professor Dumbledore would like to say a few words.
Dumbledore;The first years, please note that the Dark Forest is strictly forbidden to all students.
McGonagall;When I call your name, you will come forth.
Sorting Hat;Ah, right then... hmm... right.
Ron;Harry, what is it?
Harry;Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.
Sorting Hat;Hmm... difficult, very difficult.
Sorting Hat;Plenty of courage, I see.
Sorting Hat;Not a bad mind, either.
Harry;Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!
Sorting Hat;Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure?
Sorting Hat;You could be great, you know.
Sorting Hat;It's all here, in your head.
Sorting Hat;And Slytherin will help you on the way to greatnesses, no doubt about that.
Sorting Hat;No? Well, if you're sure.
McGonagall;Your attention, please.
Percy;But everyone knows, its the Dark Arts he fancies.
Girl;Look, It's the Bloody Baron!
Percy;Hello, Sir Nicholas.
Sir Nicholas;Dismal. Once again, my request to join the Headless Hunt has been denied.
Sir Nicholas;I prefer Sir Nicholas, if you don't mind.
Percy;Gryffindors, follow me please.
Boy;Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.
Percy;Oh, and keep an eye on the staircases.
Percy;Quickly now, come on. Come on.
Girl;Oh, look! Look!
Percy;Follow me, everyone. Keep up.
Percy;Quickly, come on.
Percy;Girls, the same on your right.
McGonagall;Thank you for that assessment, Mr Weasley.
McGonagall;Perhaps, lt'd be more useful if I were to transfigure Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocket-watch.
McGonagall;That way, one of you might be on time.
Snape;As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion-making.
Snape;However, for those select few who possess the predisposition I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses.
Snape;Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confident enough to not pay attention.
Snape;Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?
Snape;You don't know? Well, let's try again.
Harry;I don't know, Sir.
Harry;I don't know, Sir.
Harry;Clearly, Hermione knows.
Snape;Put your hand down, you silly girl!
Snape;For your information, Potter
Seamus;Eye of rabbit, harp string hum
Ron;Actually managed a weak tea yesterday, before...
Dean;Hey, look! Neville's got a Remembrall
Hermione;When the smoke turns red, it means you've forgotten something.
Neville;The only problem is, I can't remember what I've forgotten.
"Harry;""Believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown Gringotts goblins while acknowledging the breach", insist nothing was taken.
Madam Hooch;Good afternoon, class.
Class;Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.
Madam Hooch;Good afternoon, Amanda.
Madam Hooch;Well, what are you waiting for? 
Madam Hooch;Come on now, hurry up. 
"Madam Hooch;""Stick your right hand over the broom and say"," """"Up."""""""
Ron;Shut up, Harry.
Madam Hooch;And grip it tight, you don't wanna be sliding off the end.
Madam Hooch;Keep your broom steady, hover for a moment
Madam Hooch;On my whistle. Three, two...
Neville;Down, down!
Madam Hooch;Poor boy. Come on now, up you get.
Madam Hooch;Understand? If I see a single broom in the air the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts before they can say, Quidditch.
Malfoy;Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze, he'd have remembered to fall on his fat arse.
Harry;Give it here, Malfoy.
Malfoy;What's the matter, Potter?
Hermione;Harry, no way!
Hermione;Besides, you don't even know how to fly.
Malfoy;Have it your way, then.
Boy;Nice going, Harry.
Boy;That was wicked, Harry!
McGonagall;Professor Quirrell, excuse me.
McGonagall;Potter, this is Oliver Wood.
McGonagall;Wood, I have found you a Seeker.
Harry ;A century, according to McGonagall.
Ron  ;Fred and George are on the team, too. 
George  ;Can't make any promises, of course. 
George  ;Rough game, Quidditch.
Ron  ;And you'll be great, too!
Ron  ;I'm telling you, it's spooky. 
Hermione  ;The staircases change, remember?
Harry  ;Run! Quick, let's hide through that door!
Ron  ;That's it, we're done for!
Hermione  ;Oh, move over! 
Hermione ;Standard book of spells, Chapter 7.
Filch;Anyone here, my sweet? Come on.
Hermione ; You don't use your eyes, do you? 
Ron  ;Or maybe you didn't notice, there were three!
Oliver ;Now, the chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of those three hoops. 
Oliver  ;Careful now, it's comin' back. 
Oliver ;Ah, you like it now. 
Oliver  ;You catch this, the game is over. 
Flitwick;Uh, do you all have your feathers? Good. 
Hermione  ;Besides, youre saying it wrong. 
Hermione  ;It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.
Ron  ;Go on, go on.
Flitwick  ;Oh, well done! 
Flitwick  ;See here, everyone! 
Flitwick  ;Oh, splendid!
Harry  ;I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor.
Ron  ;It's Leviosa, not Leviosar. 
Ron  ;Honestly, she's a nightmare. 
Dumbledore; Everyone will please, not panic. 
Dumbledore;Now, Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. 
Girl  ;Hufflepuff, this way!
Harry  ;Hermione, move!
Ron  ;Hey, pea brain! 
Harry ;Whooa! Whoa, whoa! 
McGonagall ;Oh! Oh, my goodness! 
McGonagall ;E-Explain yourselves, both of you!
Ron and Harry;Well, what it is...
Hermione  ;It's my fault, Professor McGonagall. 
Ron;Mind you, we did save her life.
Harry;Mind you, she might not have needed saving if you hadn't insulted her.
Ron;Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.
Hermione;Ron's right, Harry. 
Snape  ;Good luck today, Potter. 
Harry  ;The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults.
Harry  ; He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret.
Hermione  ;Bit early for mail, isn't it?
Ron  ;Thats not just a broomstick, Harry. 
OIiver  ;Scared, Harry?
Oliver  ;Er, I don't really remember. 
Lee Jordan;Hello, and welcome to Hogwarts' first Quidditch game of the season! 
Madam Hooch;Now, I want a nice clean game...from all of you. 
Lee Jordan;Remember, the snitch is worth 150 points. 
Ron  ;Come on, Hermione!
Hagrid ; Well, of course he's got a name. 
Hagrid  ;That's top secret, that is.
Hermione  ;Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a curse when I see one. 
Ron  ;My parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother, Charlie. 
Hermione  ;Good. You can help Harry, then. 
Ron;Harry, wake up! 
Ron;Come on Harry, wake up!
Ron  ;Happy Christmas, Harry.
Harry  ;Happy Christmas, Ron. 
Ron  ;Oh, Mum made it. 
Ron  ;Well, let's see then. 
"Harry;""It just said"," """"Use it well."""""""
Snape  ;You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell.
Harry  ;Now, come on!
Harry  ;Come on. Come. Come look, it's my parents!
Harry;You see them, don't you? 
Ron  ;That's me! Only, I'm head boy...and 
Ron  ;And bloody hell, I'm Quidditch Captain too! 
Ron  ;Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?
George  ;Do you like yours, Ron?
Dumbledore  ;Back again, Harry?
Dumbledore  ;The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is.
Harry  ;So, then it shows us what we want? 
Dumbledore  ;It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. 
Dumbledore  ;But remember this, Harry. 
Dumbledore  ;Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. 
Dumbledore  ;That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again.
Hermione;Look at you, playing with your cards.
Hermione;Alright, what are the 3 most crucial ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion?
Hermoine;No, you won't.
Ron;You have got to start standing up to people, Neville.
Neville;No, that's all I need!
Seamus;I don't appreciate the insinuation, Longbottom.
Seamus;Besides, if anyone cared to notice my eyebrows have completely grown back!
Ron;For the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon blood...and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicholas Flamel!
Hermione  ;Honestly, don't you two read? 
Filch  ;God, I miss the screaming. 
Filch  ;A sorry lot this, Hagrid. 
Hagrid  ;Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania? 
Hagrid  ;He's only a baby, after all.
Filch  ;You're going into the forest, after all. 
Filch ; There's more than werewolves in those trees, lad. 
Harry ; Hagrid, what's that?
Hagrid  ;See that? That's unicorn's blood, that is. 
Hagrid  ;Now, this one's been injured bad by something. 
Hagrid  ;So, it's our job to find the poor beast. 
Hagrid ;Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward. }
Malfoy;Scared, Potter?! 
Malfoy;Come on, Fang.  Scared.
Harry ;What is it, Fang?
Firenze  ;Harry Potter, you must leave. 
Firenze ;You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. 
Hagrid ;Hello there, Firenze. 
Hagrid ;You all right there, Harry? 
Firenze  ;Harry Potter, this is where I leave you. 
Harry  ;Snape doesn't want the stone for himself, he wants the stone for Voldemort. 
Harry  ;With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. 
Harry ; I think if he'd had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight.
Ron ; And to think, I've been worrying about my Potions final!
Hermione  ;As long as Dumbledore's around, you're safe. 
Hermione  ;As long as Dumbledore's around, you can't be touched. 
Hermione ; I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable.
Ron  ; All right there, Harry?
Harry  ;Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one?
Harry  ;I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets? 
Harry  ;Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg?
Hagrid  ;Well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. 
Hagrid ; Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy!
Hagrid ; How often do you come across a three headed dog, even if you're in the trade? 
"Hagrid ;""But I told him. I said"," """"The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him."""
Harry ; We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!
McGonagall  ;I don't know how you three found out about the stone, but I can assure you it is perfectly well-protected. 
Harry  ;It was Snape, which means he knows how to get past Fluffy.
Snape ;Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this?
Ron  ;Go, you shouldn't be here!
Neville;You're sneaking out again, arent you?
Ron;Brilliant, but scary.
Ron  ;It's for your own good, you know.
Harry  ;If something bad happens, get yourselves out…
Ron  ;Lucky this plant-thing is here, really.
Hermione ;Stop moving, both of you. 
Hermione ;If you don't, it will only kill you faster.
Ron  ;Oh, now I can relax!
Hermione  ;He's not relaxing, is he?
Harry ;Ron, are you okay?
Harry  ;They're not birds, they're keys. 
Ron   ;Well, it was worth a try.
Hermione  ;What's wrong, Harry?
Ron  ;If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can! 
Ron ; It's obvious, isn't it? 
Ron ;All right. Harry, you take the empty Bishop's square. 
Ron ;Hermione, you'll be the Queen's side castle. 
Ron ;As for me, I'll be a knight.
Ron  ;You understand right, Harry. 
Ron  ;Once I make my move, the Queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the King.
Harry  ;No, Ron! No!
Ron;Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it. 
Harry  ;NO! Don't move! Dont forget, we're still playing. 
Harry  ;Take care of Ron. Then, go to the owlery. 
Hermione  ;You'll be okay, Harry. 
Hermione  ;You're a great wizard, you really are.
Hermione;Friendship, and bravery. 
Hermione;And Harry, just be careful.
Quirrell ;Yes. He does seem the type, doesn't he? 
Quirrell  ;No, dear boy. I tried to kill you! 
Quirrell  ;Very good Potter, yes. 
Quirrell  ;While everyone else was running to the dungeon, he went to the 3rd floor to head me off. 
Quirrell  ;Master, you are not strong enough.
Voldemort  ;Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. 
Voldemort  ;Together, we can bring them back. 
Voldemort  ;That's it, Harry. 
Voldemort  ;There is only power, and those too weak to seek it. 
Voldemort  ;Together, we'll do extraordinary things. 
Dumbledore ;Good afternoon, Harry. 
Dumbledore;Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs.
Harry ;But, what happened to the Stone?
Dumbledore  ;Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. 
Dumbledore;But yes, he will die.
Harry  ;How is it I got the Stone, sir? 
Harry  ;One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next...
Dumbledore ;Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. 
Dumbledore ;Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him?
Dumbledore ;She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark. 
Dumbledore;I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavoured one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. 
Harry;All right there, Ron?
Dumbledore;In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312 points. 
Malfoy;Nice one, Mate! 
Dumbledore ;However, recent events must be taken into account. 
Dumbledore;Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of direction is in order. 
Hagrid;Come on now, hurry up. You'll be late. 
Hermione;Come on, Harry.
Hagrid;Thought you were leaving without saying good-bye, didja? 
Harry;Thanks, Hagrid. 
Harry;But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that.
Hagrid;I do. But your cousin don't, do he? Eh? Off you go.
Hermione;Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?
